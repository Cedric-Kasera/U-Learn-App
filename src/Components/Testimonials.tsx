            During the pandemic, everything went out of order. Later on, I
            stumbled upon Schoolhouse.world. It was amazing since I didn't have
            to pay, reveal my personal details, and I did not have a hard time
            using it since it is very accessible. The global community amazed
            me. It was amazing that a shared love for learning integrated
            different people from different parts of the world.
